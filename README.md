My solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020), in C.

For now, the goal is simply to finish all challenges and get more comfortable writing C.

I have not spent any time benchmarking the code (for now), but might eventually follow [Tim Visee](https://timvisee.com/blog/solving-aoc-2020-in-under-a-second/)'s example to get all the solutions to run in under 1 second (in total).
